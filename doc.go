// Package govisor provides a pure Go process management framework.
// This is similar in concept to supervisord, but the implementation
// and the interfaces are wholly different.  Some inspiration is taken
// from Solaris' SMF facility.
//
// Unlike other frameworks, the intention is that this framework is not
// a replacement for your system's master process management (i.e. init,
// upstart, or similar), but rather a tool for user's (or administrators)
// to manage their own groups of processes as part of application
// deployment.
//
// Multiple instances of govisor may be deployed, and an instance may
// be deployed using Go's HTTP handler framework, so that it is possible
// to register the manager within an existing server instance.
//
